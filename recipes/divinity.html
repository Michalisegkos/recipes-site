<h4>ingredients</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup light corn syrup</li>
        <li>½ cup hot water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 egg whites</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>instructions</h4>

    <ul>
        <h3>step 1</h3>
        <li>Combine sugar, corn syrup, hot water, and salt in a heavy-bottomed 2-quart saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until sugar dissolves and mixture comes to a boil. Continue to cook, without stirring, until mixture reaches 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) on a candy thermometer, or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a rigid ball. Frequently wipe crystals forming on the sides of the pan, using a pastry brush dipped in water. Remove from heat.</li>
        <h3>step 2</h3>
        <li>Just as the syrup is reaching temperature, begin whipping egg whites: In a large glass or stainless steel mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Pour hot syrup in a thin stream over beaten egg whites, beating constantly with the electric mixer at medium speed. Increase speed to high, and continue beating for about 5 minutes. Add vanilla; continue beating until the mixture becomes stiff and begins to lose its gloss. If it is too stiff, add a few drops of hot water. </li>
        <h3>step 3</h3>
        <li>Immediately drop by teaspoonfuls onto waxed paper. For a decorative flair, twirl the top with the spoon when dropping. Let stand until set and dry on the outside, at least 8 hours. Store in a single layer in an airtight container at room temperature.</li>
    </ul>
